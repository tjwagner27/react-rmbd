# Movie Database App using React JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Hello and Welcome! 

This app was created following a tutorial by Thomas Weibenfalk (links below).
The purpose of this app is purely educational.
In addition to learning React JS through the tutorial, I am becoming familiar with github, git commands and developing a feel for potential work flows in preparation to contributing to open source projects.
